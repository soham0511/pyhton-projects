Simple Beginner level Python Projects. 

In the PDF Text Extractor Project you need to install the PyPDF2 module first before executing. A sample PDF file is provided along with the file, which you can refer to. For installing the module write "pip install PyPDF2" in your terminal.

In the Password Generator Project you donot need to install anything externally as all the modules in the projects come built-in with your pyhton file.

The Python Dino Game Project requires you to install pyautogui and pillow modules from the terminal by writing:
pip install pyautogui
pip install pillow

The Railway Announcement System requires you to install pandas, pydub and gTTs. If you face any problem in installing the pydub module then go to the link https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ .

To use the Projects involving some game you need to install pygame module from the terminal and the statement for installation:
pip install pygame

Note: the modules which are not mentioned above come built-in with your python installation file, so no need to install them explicitely.
In case you are using some IDE where terminal option is absent, then you can go to your command-line-prompt for installation.
In the cmd you need to write
pip install <module-name>
  and your module will be installed.
