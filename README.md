# pyhton-projects
Simple Beginner level Python Projects. 

In the PDF Text Extractor Project you need to install the PyPDF2 module first before executing. A sample PDF file is provided along with the file, which you can refer to. For installing the module write "pip install PyPDF2" in your terminal.

In the Password Generator Project you donot need to install anything externally as all the modules in the projects come built-in with your pyhton file.

The Python Dino Game Project requires you to install pyautogui and pillow modules from the terminal by writing:
pip install pyautogui
pip install pillow

The Railway Announcement System requires you to install pandas, pydub and gTTs. If you face any problem in installing the pydub module then go to the link https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ .

To use the Projects involving some game you need to install pygame module from the terminal and the statement for installation:
pip install pygame
                                                                                                                                                                   
 
In the DRS Review System Project you need to have pillow, cv2,imutils and modules.                                                                                 
To install:                                                                                                                                                         
pip install opencvpython                                                                                                                                           
pip install pillow                                                                                                                                                 
pip install imutils                                                                                                                                                 
other modules come build-in with your python file.                                                                                                                 
You need to have a video in mp4 format within the same folder as the program named as "clip.mp4", you can also change its name from the code.But, make sure video is in mp4 format otherwise it might create problem during image processing.                                                                                               


Warning: In the Corona-Virus Notification Project we had scraped our data from Ministry of Health Official Site, where a table of number of cases in different states were available at the time when this program was written, but currently the table class has been removed from the site.                                                             
Note: the modules which are not mentioned above come built-in with your python installation file, so no need to install them explicitely.
In case you are using some IDE where terminal option is absent, then you can go to your command-line-prompt for installation.
In the cmd you need to write
pip install <module-name>                                                                                                                                                     and your module will be installed.                                                                                                                                              
  
It might seem that our project for Corona-Virus Notification is ineffective, but there is another way of scraping that data, I had not uploaded the code here on purpose. Though you might study the plyer documentation to find a solution.

In the Desktop Assisstant Project you are required to install pyttsx3, speechrecognition and pyaudio module. There is a part in the project for sending email but before that make sure to allow access to non secure apps from google chrome settings. Also there is a part where the program requires your username and password, so make sure that you are not giving any personal information to the public.                                                                                             
Note: To install pyttsx3 module write pip install pyttsx3==2.71                                                                                                       
and you might face issues during installations of pyaudio module then, you have to download additional files required for installation of pyaudio from this website   https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 download the files according to the specifications of your system.                                                                                                  After installing the files write pip install pyaudio in terminal.
